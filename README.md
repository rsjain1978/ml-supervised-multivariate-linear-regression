# ml-supervised-multivariate-regression

## Introduction
This project contains a .ipynb file, a .py file and a .csv file. You can open the code file (.ipynb) file in Jupyter notebook and simply press the run icon to execute the code. Alternatively you can open the .py file in your favourite editor.

This code reads a csv file which has some fictional data of a company; each recrod contains data for three variables
1.Demography (Urban or Rural)
2.Marketing Spend 
3.Revenue. 

Code tries to do a do a multi-variate linear regression analysis between the independent variables (Demography & Marketing Spend)  & Revenue (assumed as dependent variable). 

At the end code prints out the intercept and the coeffecients for both of the independent variables.
